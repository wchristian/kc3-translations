      "24" : "Commander, what? This important discussion. Is it about the 17th Destroyer Division's formation? What, it's not? Then is it something about that Hamakaze? It has nothing to do with Hamakaze... I see. Nn... That ring... to me... w-what... eh! U-um...",

      "50" : "2000. Admiral, how was the cabbage roll? It tasted a bit like a croquette and was delicious, right? Yep, yep. Thank goodness, maybe!",
      "51" : "2100. Alright! It'll be the end of the day once I've done the dishes. I might be tired!",
      "52" : "2200. Oh, somehow it's noisy from the direction of the torpedo squadron even though it's nighttime, maybe. Eh? It can't be helped? I see, so that's how it is.",
